## Introduction & Basic Info
- ### Git
Git is a version-controlling system, in which you can store each and every version of a file or directory, and access each version enabling a history of changes, for example you can click 'history' of this file and you will be able to see all the changes made.
- ### Github
Github is a platform build on top of Git where you can store/share repositories and collabrate them. Github is the most popular & one of many ways on how you manage Git easily.
