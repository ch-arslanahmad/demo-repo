# Setup Git

As you know you can use,

```bash
git clone github.com/username/repo.git # via HTTPS

git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git # via SSH
```

Using these commands you can easily `clone` any public repo..

To get access to any `private` repo, you need

- have a GitHub/GitLab (etc) account
- read/write access to repo

For that you need to login to `git` via the account, you can login via:

- HTTPS
- SSH
