# Git

Git is a distributed version control technology built by Linus Torwalts, initially built in 10 days, used to track changes in files and coordinate work among multiple people.

## What it does:

- Tracks history of changes (commits) for files and directories.
- Allows branching and merging without affecting the main history.
- Supports collaboration via remote repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
